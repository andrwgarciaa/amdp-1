#AMDP 1 Project
A responsive webpage made for BINUS University IT Division training project. Made with pure HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

Some missing features:
- (Mobile view) Register form shifted up from keyboard pop-up.
- (Mobile view) Navbar design too bland.
- (Desktop view) 'Home' nav shifted to the left on 'Products' hover.
- Register form margin and paddings too cramped.
- Responsive on very small screen is broken.
